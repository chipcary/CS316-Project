Using generatedata.org, we created two datasets: a dataset for the users in our database, which included variables like the user's email,
their name, they city and state where they live, a time slot during the day when they're available to volunteer, how long they can
volunteer for a particular job, the date they can volunteer, and then three variables where the users rank their top 3 interests. This 
dataset had 5000 unique rows, which were created using generatedata's algorithm, in addition to specifying the parameters ourselves for 
certain variables. We created the project dataset in similar fashion, and its variabls include the project creator's email, the city and 
state where they're from, they time slot the project work starts, how long volunteers are needed for, the data of the project, a tag that 
describes the basic idea of the project, a current capacity variable indicating how many volunteers have signed, and finally, a goal 
capacity variable for the maximum amount of volunteers necessary for a certain project. The project dataset has 1000 unique rows.
