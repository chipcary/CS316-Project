Created the schema for our relational database. Also created the back end API for the front end to interface with the PSQL database. Did a lot of the planning regarding how the entire project will look at a high level.

Used scripts to gather test data for when we fully integrate the front end and the back end. Gave the rest of the group a lot of input regarding how we will take actual data and input it into our database.
